------------------ JavaScript -----------------

Framework: collection of libraries
Eg: AngularJs, BootStrap, Tailwind

library: it is a collection of methods or function
Eg: ReactJs, JQuery, NodeJs, popperjs

----------------- 𝗥𝗘𝗔𝗖𝗧 -----------------

--> react is a library
--> it is used to developed single page application
--> it is a component based application
--> component reusable
--> react is declartive
--> NOTE : react will renders componenton the wed page without page re-loading.

- the previous 𝙙𝙤𝙢 𝙜𝙚𝙩𝙨 𝙙𝙚𝙨𝙩𝙧𝙤𝙮𝙚𝙙 and new dom will be reacted -> 𝙥𝙖𝙜𝙚 𝙧𝙚𝙡𝙤𝙖𝙙𝙨

- any updates made in react will reflect on the 𝙫𝙞𝙧𝙩𝙪𝙖𝙡-𝙙𝙤𝙢
- then compares with 𝙖𝙘𝙩𝙪𝙖𝙡-𝙙𝙤𝙢 and update the 𝙖𝙘𝙩𝙪𝙖𝙡-𝙙𝙤𝙢 -> 𝙬𝙞𝙩𝙝𝙤𝙪𝙩 𝙥𝙖𝙜𝙚 𝙧𝙚𝙡𝙤𝙖𝙙𝙞𝙣𝙜

- when ever we create any element in the virtual-dom for that element an 𝘂𝗻𝗶𝗾𝘂𝗲-𝗸𝗲𝘆 is generated
so, when already existing element is created react will start checking the key if its unique or not 
if unique -> this will be added to the actual-dom

- 𝙤𝙣𝙚 𝙩𝙤 𝙤𝙣𝙚 𝙢𝙖𝙥𝙥𝙞𝙣𝙜  ( this is done by an algorithm i.e. 𝙙𝙞𝙛𝙛𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙖𝙡𝙜𝙤𝙧𝙞𝙩𝙝𝙢)
- react uses 𝙙𝙞𝙛𝙛𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙖𝙡𝙜𝙤𝙧𝙞𝙩𝙝𝙢 (reason behind one-to-one mapping)
- react uses a 𝙈𝙑𝘾 (𝙈𝙤𝙙𝙚𝙡 𝙑𝙞𝙚𝙬 𝘾𝙤𝙣𝙩𝙧𝙤𝙡𝙡𝙚𝙧) 𝙖𝙧𝙘𝙝𝙞𝙩𝙚𝙘𝙩𝙪𝙧𝙚

- when ever React is installed by default 3 dependencies are installed
    ▪ react
        ▫ createElement, all-hooks
    ▪ react-dom
        ▫ used to create virtual-dom
    ▪ react-script
        ▫ used to run, debug, test, eject react application

2013 by Facebook (meta), Jordan Walke --> based on AJAX concept

2007 - AngularJS by Microsoft
react is smaller library than angularjs but has more impact
after creation of react - angular was made open-source and then react too

before react used - AJAX (its a developers gift)
- by using AJAX u can fetch the data from server/api -> without page reloading

till today companies use AJAX (Eg: Google Maps, etc)

    1️⃣ CDN way (third party and needed ethernet all time)
    2️⃣ NodeJs way (preferred)

NPM
   ➡ it is used to install, update, delete packages in a JavaScript
   ➡ here packages will be installed globally

        𝚗𝚙𝚖 𝚒𝚗𝚜𝚝𝚊𝚕𝚕 -𝚐 𝚌𝚛𝚎𝚊𝚝𝚎-𝚛𝚎𝚊𝚌𝚝-𝚊𝚙𝚙𝚕𝚒𝚌𝚊𝚝𝚒𝚘𝚗
        𝚌𝚛𝚎𝚊𝚝𝚎-𝚛𝚎𝚊𝚌𝚝-𝚊𝚙𝚙 𝚙𝚛𝚘𝚓𝚎𝚌𝚝-𝚗𝚊𝚖𝚎

NPX
   ➡ used to execute packages without installing it
   ➡ no need of globally while installing the packages
        npx create-react-app project-name
        
for latest version of react -> use vite yarn
        npm create vite@latest  --> install the latest version of react

:3000 --> older version below 18

:5174 --> lastest react
